# PES Assignment 4: DIA Trains

In assignment 4 I implemented a train monitoring system using a finite state machines, which has a terminal/baggage claim(T), two concourse stops A and B and train storageshed(S). An indicator light in the control room dashboard shows the current position of the train and itâ€™s distance between the stops.

NOTE to TA's: You can set the touch offeset value in my "mytouch.h" header file at LINE 23.
             PLEASE KEEP YOUR FINGER ENTIRELY and just LIGHTLY touch. Thank you :D  ....

             For the Switch part i have used port D pin 5 (PTD5) [J2 junction 2 pin 4] as my switch. connect this to the ground pin to go into emergency state
